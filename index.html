          <h3>How to Web Development in 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Starting in web development can be overwhelming because there are so
            many technologies, frameworks, and skills - that someone might need
            to know. Let's take a 10'000ft overview of what's going on when it
            comes to front-end development. Get an idea of possible learning
            paths, the different specializations in web development and useful
            resources the become an awesome developer.

          <h3>Modern Framworks in a Nutshell</h3>
          <p>
            Pure HTML & CSS are superb to set up your first website, but when it
            comes to business applications it's all about JavaScript frameworks
            these days. If you try to google "best JavaScript framework" you
            will get a lot of bias and only a few useful comparisons. Most
            frameworks share common patterns and ideas, so let's talk about what
            they have in common - and what makes them different.

          <h3>Layouting with CSS in 2019</h3>
          <p>
            In the old days of layouts with CSS, it was all about tables and
            floats, but thankfully these days are over. Nowadays it's all about
            CSS Grid and Flexbox - the two swiss army knives of Layouting. Let's
            dive into modern approaches of layout powered by CSS in 2019.

          <h3>No one knows what they are doing</h3>
          <p>
            Go into detail about how all of us feel the pressure no matter how
            long we have been in the industry. The idea is that as soon as you
            start coding you will have this in the back of your mind so you
            don’t feel alone or bad when you feel like you don’t know what you
            are doing.

          <h3>A11Y - Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            Imagine being on the phone and trying to use a website at the same
            time, or think about a blind person accessing the web. We need to
            build our websites in ways that everyone can use them, no matter
            their physical capabilities. The web is for everyone and we need to
            build it that way. So let's take a look at how we can make our
            websites accessible for all our users.

          <h3>Animations</h3>
          <p>
            Movement conveys meaning. Through animations we can grab the users
            attention and make our content more meaningful. We will look at what
            we can (and should) animate, how CSS animations work and what things
            we should be paying attention when adding movement to websites.

          <h3>Resources, Learning, Getting help</h3>
          <p>
            There is too much internet, it’s easy to get lost and not know what
            to search or learn. This talk aims at showing useful things we have
            found when scrapping the internet for materials. It will also guide
            you through how some of us approach learning and asking for help.

          <h3>One year in tech - a newcomers retrospective</h3>
          <p>
            Show people how it feels to be new in this industry, how people are
            not as scary as they seem and they really just want to help. The
            idea is to show someone who is new in the industry but has asserted
            themselves in the community and can tell some stories.
