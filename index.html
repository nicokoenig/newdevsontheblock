          <p>
            Once you started walking down the web development road, one of your
            next stops will be JavaScript. It's the world's most popular
            programming language for a couple of reasons: It can run in most
            places like the browser, backend. It's super approachable for
            newcomers as their first programming language. And it can be used in
            a wide variety of fields like Interactivity, Data Visualization,
            Generative Art.

          <h3>Layouting with CSS in 2019</h3>
          <p>
            In the old days of layouts with CSS, it was all about tables and
            floats, but thankfully these days are over. Nowadays it's all about
            CSS Grid and Flexbox - the two swiss army knives of Layouting. Let's
            dive into modern approaches of layout powered by CSS in 2019.

          <p>
            Go into detail about how all of us feel the pressure no matter how
            long we have been in the industry. The idea is that as soon as you
            start coding you will have this in the back of your mind so you
            don’t feel alone or bad when you feel like you don’t know what you
            are doing.

          <h3>A11Y - Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            Imagine being on the phone and trying to use a website at the same
            time, or think about a blind person accessing the web. We need to
            build our websites in ways that everyone can use them, no matter
            their physical capabilities. The web is for everyone and we need to
            build it that way. So let's take a look at how we can make our
            websites accessible for all our users.

          <h3>Animations</h3>
          <p>
            Movement conveys meaning. Through animations we can grab the users
            attention and make our content more meaningful. We will look at what
            we can (and should) animate, how CSS animations work and what things
            we should be paying attention when adding movement to websites.

            to search or learn. This talk aims at showing useful things we have
            found when scrapping the internet for materials. It will also guide
            you through how some of us approach learning and asking for help.
