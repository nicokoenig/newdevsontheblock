      <h3>Vienna Workshop Postponed</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the current situation around the COVID-19 outbreak, <strong>we've decided to postpone our Vienna workshop.</strong> 
        We want to be sure that we're running the workshop under safe conditions. So once there's more certainty that we can do that, 
        we'll announce the new dates and re-open registration.
